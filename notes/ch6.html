<h1>6. Inspecting the path</h1>

<p>
  We mentioned early on that Syro can match and capture path segments,
  but how exactly?  In this chapter we will examine the <code>path</code>
  object to see how it keeps track of the current and previous
  paths.
</p>

<p>
  The following example builds the response gradually. That is, it
  uses <code>res.write</code> more than once, and the response
  contains an array of the successive calls.
</p>

<pre>
  require <span>"syro"</span>

  app = Syro.new do
    res.write sprintf(<span>"%s|%s"</span>, path.prev, path.curr)

    on <span>"foo"</span> do
      res.write sprintf(<span>"%s|%s"</span>, path.prev, path.curr)

      on <span>"bar"</span> do
        res.write sprintf(<span>"%s|%s"</span>, path.prev, path.curr)
      end
    end
  end

  env = {
    <span>"REQUEST_METHOD"</span> => <span>"GET"</span>,
    <span>"PATH_INFO"</span>      => <span>"/foo/bar"</span>,
  }

  p app.call(env)
</pre>

<p>
  Output:
</p>

<pre>
  [200,
   {<span>"Content-Length"</span>=><span>"27"</span>,
    <span>"Content-Type"</span>=><span>"text/html"</span>},
   [<span>"|/foo/bar"</span>, <span>"/foo|/bar"</span>, <span>"/foo/bar|"</span>]]
</pre>

<p>
  While building the response, we put a pipe at the position where
  <code>path.prev</code> and <code>path.curr</code> would be joined.
  As the path segments were matched, parts of <code>path.curr</code>
  were moved to <code>path.prev</code>. Each call to <code>on</code>
  uses the current version of the path (<code>path.curr</code>) and
  ignores the rest.  That is what allows Syro to match successive
  segments with nested blocks.
</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
  Replace some matcher with a capture by using a symbol. How does
  it behave?
