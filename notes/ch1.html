<h1>1. Hello World!</h1>

<p>
  Open a file called <code>app.rb</code> and type the following
  code:
</p>

<pre>
  require <span>"syro"</span>

  App = Syro.new do
    get do
      res.text <span>"hello, world"</span>
    end
  end
</pre>

<p>
  You can run the code with Ruby:
</p>

<pre>
  ruby ./app.rb
</pre>

<p>
  But as expected, you won't see any output. A Syro app can be
  called by passing a hash with CGI variables, so let's give it a
  try.  Append the following code to the file:
</p>

<pre>
  env = {
    <span>"REQUEST_METHOD"</span> =&gt; <span>"GET"</span>,
    <span>"PATH_INFO"</span>      =&gt; <span>"/"</span>,
  }

  p App.call(env)
</pre>

<p>
  If you run the code again, you will get this output:
</p>

<pre>
  [200,
   {<span>"Content-Length"</span>=&gt;<span>"12"</span>,
    <span>"Content-Type"</span>=&gt;<span>"text/plain"</span>},
   [<span>"hello, world"</span>]]
</pre>

<p>
  If you are familiar with Rack, you will recognize the output.  If
  not, reading about Rack will come handy later on.
</p>

<p>
  You can see that the body of the response contained the string
  <code>"hello, world"</code>. That's because the block that was passed to
  <code>get</code> was executed. When <code>get</code> is called,
  it checks two things: first, it makes sure the
  <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code> is <code>"GET"</code>; then it checks
  <code>"PATH_INFO"</code> to see if we are at the end of the path.
  The terminal <code>"/"</code> is considered the end of the path,
  and as <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code> was set to <code>"GET"</code>
  the block passed to <code>get</code> was evaluated. Finally, the
  response was generated and returned.
</p>

<p>
  We will see later how to run this code with a webserver, but for
  now it's better to get familiar with the underlying mechanics.
</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
  Change the value of <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code> and run the program
  again. Does it work as expected? Change the value of
  <code>PATH_INFO</code>, run it again. What happens?
